I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol.
Foes that want ta make sure my caskets closed.
Rap critics that say hes Money Cash Hoes.
Im from the hood stupid what type of facts are those.
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos.
Youd celebrate the minute you was having dough.

Got beef with radio if I dont play they show.
They dont play my hits well I dont give a shit so.
Rap mags try and use my black ass.

Years  and my trunk is raw.
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law.
I got two choices yall pull over the car or hmm.
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor.
Now I aint trying to see no highway chase with Jake.
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case.
So I pull over to the side of the road.
I heard Son do you know why Im stopping you for.
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low.
Or do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know.
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo.

License and registration and step out of the car.
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are.
I aint stepping out of shit all my papers legit.
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit.
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back.
And I know my rights so you goin need a warrant for that.
Arent you sharp as a tack You some type of lawyer or something.

Now once upon a time not too long ago.
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a ho.
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy.
But a pussy having no goddamn sense try and push me.
I tried to ignore em talk to the Lord.
Pray for em cause some fools just love to perform.
You know the type loud as a motorbike.
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight.
The only thing thats goin happen is Ima get to clapping and.
He and his boys goin be yapping to the captain.
And there I go trapped in the Kit Kat again.
Back through the system with the riff raff again.
Fiends on the floor scratching again.
Paparazzis with they cameras snapping them.
DA tried to give a nigga shaft again.
Half a mil for bail cause Im African.
All because this fool was harassing them.
Trying to play the boy like hes saccharine.
But aint nothing sweet bout how I hold my gun.
I got ninety nine problems being a bitch aint one hit me.
