if you do n't like my lyrics , you can press fast forward

they do n't play my hits , well , i do n't give a shit , so
rap mags try and use my black ass
so advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads , fuckers

year 's '94 and my trunk is raw
in my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law

bounce on the devil , put the pedal to the floor
now i ai n't trying to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i could fight the case
so i , pull over to the side of the road
i heard son , do you know why i 'm stopping you for
cause i 'm young and i 'm black and my hat 's real low
or do i look like a mind reader , sir i do n't know
am i under arrest or should i guess some mo.
well you was doing fifty-five in the fifty-four , uh huh
license and registration and step out of the car
are you carrying a weapon on you , i know a lot of you are
i ai n't stepping out of shit , all my papers legit
well do you mind if i look around the car a little bit
well my glove compartment is locked , so is the trunk and the back
and i know my rights so you goin ' need a warrant for that
are n't you sharp as a tack you some type of lawyer or something
somebody important or something
child , i ai n't passed the bar , but i know a little bit
enough that you wo n't illegally search my shit

now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strong arm a ho
this is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
but a pussy having no goddamn sense try and push me
i tried to ignore 'em , talk to the lord
pray for 'em , cause some fools just love to perform
you know the type , loud as a motorbike
but would n't bust a grape in a fruit fight
the only thing that 's goin ' happen is i ` ma get to clapping and
he and his boys goin ' be yapping to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kit kat again
back through the system with the riff raff again
fiends on the floor scratching again
paparazzi 's with they cameras , snapping them
d.a. tried to give a nigga shaft again
half a mil for bail cause i 'm african
all because this fool was harassing them
trying to play the boy like he 's saccharine
but ai n't nothing sweet ` bout how i hold my gun
i got ninety nine problems being a bitch ai n't one , hit me

ninety nine problems but a bitch ai n't one
if you having girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninety nine problems but a bitch ai n't one , hit me

ninety nine problems but a bitch ai n't one
if you having girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninety nine problems but a bitch ai n't one , hit me

having girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninety nine problems and a bitch ai n't one
