## Freestyle Rap Lyric Generation
I create this as my final project for HON 310 (Creative Process in Science) at NC State University.
## Motivation
I was trying to freestyle rap to my friend, and I failed horribly. I thought, "There must be a better way to do this!" I took the opportunity to exercise my skills as a developer and make a cool project for class.
## Example output
Here are some lyrics generated from training on 99 Problems (Jay Z), Ni**as in Paris (Jay Z and Kanye West), Dirt Off Your Shoulder (Jay Z), Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It (Ice Cube), Where The Hood At (DMX), and X Gon' Give It To Ya (DMX):
